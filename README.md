# Get-Group-Membership-Headcount
Get Group Membership Headcount from your Google Apps Domain

This script will get all membership headcount from your Google Groups and return Get Group Membership Headcount.
The code is also available in our GitHub account – https://github.com/NETBEARS-IT-Outsourcing/Get-Group-Membership-Headcount

In order to use this addon, you will have to perform the following:
1) Create a sheet with the name EXACTLY like this – “headcount” and attach the script to it
2) Append the following header :
* Group Name
* Group Membership Headcount

You can also just use the spreadsheet that we created by making a copy of it and start uploading directly 
into it -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1erZvzYviGsFhaiq1YENbfx59MoFUjkl0_bWQUoSjgIQ/edit#gid=0


Here’s what the script does :
1) Goes through all your Google Groups
2) Gets the group name and group membership
3) Write in the sheet the data + the sync time

Notes:
You have to be an Administrator in your Google Apps Domain for this to work
